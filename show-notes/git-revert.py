Reverting to the Latest Commit in Git


To revert back to a previous commit session you can run:

git checkout .

#Updated 2 paths from the index  

  This will undo all changes made since last commit. It will
  not effect any untracked files but it will revert the changes
  made to tracked files into how they were before the commit.
