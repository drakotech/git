/* Basic Git Branching Workflow

git branch
//* master
  
  Shows what branch you are on, on your local machine. The
  asterisk means you are on the master branch.
 

git checkout -b readme-styling
//Switched to a new branch 'readme-styling'
  
  checkout is the command to use when creating a new branch


git branch
//master
//readme-styling
  Now here you can see that we are on the readme-styling
  branch.
