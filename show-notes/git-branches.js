/* Introduction to Git Branches

It is possible to create feature branches where we can break
the entire code base out and work on a feature. This way the
main code base is still operational for others to work on while
you can focus on building out a feature on a separate feature
branch.

Once the feature branch is completed you can then merge it to
the master branch repo so that everyone else can have access 
to them.
